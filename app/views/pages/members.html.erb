      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600">
        In May 2023, 17 pioneers joined the Playground by acquiring the first-ever <strong>PLAYING THE FUTURE</strong> pass—an NFT artwork by Felix LePeintre. This marked the beginning of a shared journey toward securing a permanent home for digital creation in Amsterdam.

      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600">
        Now, three years later, the Playground has evolved. As a passholder, you are not just a member—you can become a co-creator of this space.
